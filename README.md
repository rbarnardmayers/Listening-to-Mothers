# Listening-to-Mothers

Listening to Mothers is a project from the National Partnership for Women and Families that studies the experience of mothers and birthing people during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. 

This repository contains the code and data (eventually) that we used to generate our reports. 

The files are as follows: </ul>
<li>Data Cleaning.R: R code for reading in the Listening to Mothers data and cleaning up the data</li>
<li> Report.Rmd: An RMarkdown file with the report outline and results embedded into it </li>
<li>Listening-to-Mothers.RProj: The project file that will automatically open the necessary files and folders</li>
